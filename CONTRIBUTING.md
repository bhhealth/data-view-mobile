# Contributing to this Repo

Tidepool welcomes contribution to this repo via PRs and bug reporting. You can find more details about each process below.


## Development Workflow

Developers contributing via PRs to this repo will use the GitHub flow development process as outlined below.

For feature development during GHC OSD we will use [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). If you are not familiar with GitHub flow, please take a few minutes to read that document. This is not to be confused with git-flow which is significantly different. If you are interested in understanding the differences between the two you can checkout this article on [GitHub flow v. git-flow](https://githubflow.github.io). 

The development process as an outside contributor is explained well [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) and will look roughly like this: 
- Fork and Clone the repo you want to contribute to and pull the develop branch  
- Create a descriptively named branch off of develop (i.e. feature-name)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
- When you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, it will be merged into the develop branch where it will be ready for the next release


## Bug Reporting

Bugs are reported and managed via GitHub issues. When reporting a bug please be sure to include the following information:

- Use a short title that summarizes the specific problem
- Introduce the problem before you post any code
- Give enough detail to enable developers to reproduce the problem
- Be ready to answer questions/respond to feedback

Additionally, make sure to add the `bug` label.


## Feature Requests

If you have an idea for a feature, but don't want to contribute via a PR you can submit a feature request via GitHub issues, making sure to add the `Feature Request` label.


## Beyond GHC OSD

# Contributing to this Repo

Developers contibuting to this repo will use the GitHub flow development process as outlined below.


## Development Workflow

For feature development during GHC OSD we will use [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). If you are not familiar with GitHub flow, please take a few minutes to read that document. This is not to be confused with git-flow which is significantly different. If you are interested in understanding the differences between the two you can checkout [this article](https://githubflow.github.io). 

As explained by Github (in [this article](https://githubflow.github.io), in short this means our development process will look like this: 
- Anything in the master branch is deployable
- To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie: new-oauth2-scopes)
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, you can merge it into master
- Once it is merged and pushed to 'master', you can and should deploy immediately



## Feature Request Protocol

If you have an idea for a feature, but don't want to contribute via a PR you can submit a feature request via GitHub issues, making sure to add the `Feature Request` label.



## Beyond GHC OSD

This project was scaled for the time we had available, possible directions it could be taken after the event include (but are not limited to):
- Additional or more complex visualizations
- Using data available via an API

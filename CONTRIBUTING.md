# Contributing to this Repo

Developers contibuting to this repo will use the GitHub flow development process as outlined below.


## Development Workflow

For feature development during GHC OSD we will use [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). If you are not familiar with GitHub flow, please take a few minutes to read that document. This is not to be confused with git-flow which is significantly different. If you are interested in understanding the differences between the two you can checkout [this article](https://githubflow.github.io). 

The development process as an outside contributor is explained well [here](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/) and will look roughly like this: 
- Fork and Clone the repo you want to contribute to and pull the develop branch  
- Create a descriptively named branch off of develop
- Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
- When you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
- After someone else has reviewed and signed off on the feature, it will be merged into the develop branch where it will be ready for the next release


## Feature Request Protocol

If you have an idea for a feature, but don't want to contribute via a PR you can submit a feature request via GitHub issues, making sure to add the `Feature Request` label.



## Beyond GHC OSD

This project was scaled for the time we had available, possible directions it could be taken after the event include (but are not limited to):
- Additional or more complex visualizations
- Using data available via an API

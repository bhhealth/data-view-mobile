# Tidepool RN Data View

This is the repo for the Tidepool Data View React Native application for the Grace Hopper Celebration Open Source Day.


## About Tidepool

Tidepool is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to make diabetes data more accessible, meaningful, and actionable for people with diabetes, their care teams, and researchers.

We believe that connected data leads to better decision-making. Tidepool is designed to help you discover insights and bring context to diabetes management. And, to help make diabetes data more actionable, we make it easy to share data with anyone you choose: caregivers, clinicians, endocrinologists, friends, researchers â€” anyone. With that in mind we are looking for ways to share the reality of diabetes with people beyond the diabetic community.


## Project Description

For the GHC 19 Open Source Day we will be focusing on creating a prototype react-native application that utilizes available data to show an average user what it means to have diabetes. This application will:

- Visually display diabetes data

Stretch goals for this application would include:

- Education about diabetes

- the ability to share data and/or insights over social media (Twitter, Instagram, etc.)

While it will be helpful if you are comfortable writing javascript, we will be walking through the life cycle of a product so there will be plenty to do for all skill levels.

Helpful Skills: Git, Node/NPM, Javascript

Bonus Skills: React, React-Native, Product Development, UI/UX


## Setup

In preparation to contribute to this project you will need to have the react native development environment setup on your computer. We recommend using the setup documentation on the react-native site found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started). We will be using Expo tools, so make sure that you can create and run a react native application following the Expo CLI Quickstart instructions.

If you are setting up your development environment on a Mac for the first time you can check out this repo for some guidance on basic local dev environment setup [here](https://github.com/thacherT1D/macosx-dev-setup).
